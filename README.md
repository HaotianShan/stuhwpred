Student Homework Finish Time Prediction Project

**Goal**
A large number of students have low productivity when completing their homework assignments. Hence, predicting the anticipated time required for task completion may help the students better manage their time.

The purpose of this project is to predict the total homework finish time of students given their specific characteristics. We conducted census sampling on all the AP computer science students in grade 10, a total of 41 students.
